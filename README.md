# Goals

This repo helps me (and other learners) to:

- Build a reproducible, well‑documented learning path across core domains: Wireless, Recon, System Security, Mobile, OSINT.  
- Develop small, well‑documented scripts and utility templates for lab automation and note keeping.  
- Keep an evidence‑based log of experiments (device models, firmware, timestamps, results) so learning is verifiable and repeatable.
- Produce a professional portfolio of learning.
